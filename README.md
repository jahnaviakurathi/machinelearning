This research proposes a deep learning-based smart surveillance system to enhance public safety by automatically detecting suspicious activities in real-time.
The system leverages advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze video data and identify anomalies such as unattended objects or aggressive behavior.
By promptly alerting authorities, this system can help prevent potential threats and improve overall security.

Keywords: smart surveillance, deep learning, public safety, anomaly detection, CNNs, video analysis.
